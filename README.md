# React eCommerce Store

Live site: [nuuYuu - React eCommerce Store]()

This project is an eCommerce web application built using React, aiming to demonstrate knowledge of building a modern online store using React. It integrates with an API to display and manage products, implement a cart system, and handle the checkout process.

# Project Goal

The goal of this project is to apply React knowledge to build an eCommerce store with the following core features:

- Product listing and individual product detail pages.
- Cart management, checkout, and a success confirmation page.
- A contact page with form validation.
- Look-ahead search functionality to filter products.
- Responsive design to ensure accessibility across devices.

## Website Architecture:

- **Homepage**
- **Individual Product Page**
- **Cart Page / Checkout page**
- **Checkout Success Page**
- **Contact Page**

## Built With:

- **React**: Core library for building the user interface.
- **React Router**: For managing navigation and routing between pages.
- **Vite**: Build tool for fast development and bundling.
- **Zustand**: For managing global state, including the cart functionality.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **Noroff API v2**: For fetching dynamic product data.

## Features

The eCommerce application includes the following features:

- **Product Listing**: The homepage lists all available products from the API.
- **Look-ahead Search**: Users can search for products in real-time, with results filtered based on the search term.
- **Product Details**: Clicking a product displays its individual page with full details, including description, price, discount (if applicable), and reviews.
- **Add to Cart**: Users can add products to the cart from the product page.
- **Cart Overview**: Displays all products in the cart, showing their quantities and total price.
- **Checkout Success**: Confirms successful orders and clears the cart.
- **Contact Form**: A form with validation for user inquiries, ensuring that all fields are correctly filled out, and if so; logs the data in the console.

## API Integration

The application utilizes the Noroff API v2 to fetch products. Products are dynamically displayed based on data fetched from the API, which includes product information such as titles, descriptions, images, prices, and discount details. API endpoints are used to retrieve individual product data by their unique IDs.

## How to Use

1. Navigate through the product list on the homepage and click on a product to view details.
2. Add products to the cart from the product page.
3. View your cart and proceed to checkout.
4. Fill out the contact form for any inquiries.

## Contact Form Validation

The form on the Contact Page has the following validation rules:

- **Full name**: Minimum 3 characters, required.
- **Subject**: Minimum 3 characters, required.
- **Email**: Must be a valid email address, required.
- **Message body**: Minimum 3 characters, required.
